# Wireless Security Assessment Lab Series

## Objective
Completed nine controlled wireless-security labs spanning discovery, WPA/WPA2 handshake capture, password auditing, rogue access points, WPS testing, MITM analysis, and automated assessment.

### Skills Learned
- Enabled monitor mode and inventoried SSIDs, BSSIDs, channels, clients, and encryption.
- Captured WPA/WPA2 handshakes and tested dictionary-based recovery.
- Simulated evil-twin, WPS, and MITM scenarios in a lab environment.
- Detected suspicious or duplicate access points and compared manual versus automated auditing.

### Tools Used
- Aircrack-ng
- Airmon-ng
- Airodump-ng
- Aireplay-ng
- Wifiphisher
- Reaver
- Kismet
- Hashcat
- Bettercap
- Wifite2

## Steps

*Ref 1: Airodump-ng captured WPA handshake evidence for the target NETHUB LR access point, including BSSID, channel, encryption, connected clients, and EAPOL frame activity.*

*Ref 2: Aireplay-ng deauthentication traffic was used in the controlled lab to force client reassociation and trigger a fresh WPA handshake capture.*

*Ref 3: Wireshark analysis filtered the capture to EAPOL frames, confirming the WPA four-way handshake packets were present for the target client and AP.*

*Ref 4: Airodump-ng reconnaissance showed nearby WPA2 access points, active stations, channels, signal strength, and packet counts used to validate target selection.*

*Ref 5: Aircrack-ng completed a dictionary-based password audit against the captured handshake and recovered the lab network key.*

*Ref 6: Wifiphisher enumerated nearby access points with BSSID, channel, encryption, WPS status, client count, and vendor details before selecting the lab target.*

*Ref 8: Reaver WPS testing targeted a selected access point, received beacon frames, attempted PIN authentication, and recorded repeated receive-timeout warnings.*

*Ref 9: Kismet provided a browser-based wireless inventory with detected APs, encryption types, channels, packet activity, signal levels, and manufacturer data.*

*Ref 10: Aircrack-ng converted the captured WPA handshake into Hashcat-compatible format and identified the NETHUB LR handshake as the cracking target.*
